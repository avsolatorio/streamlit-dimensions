# Streamlit - Dimensions

A simple streamlit component that returns the dimensions of the container where it is rendered.
This may be used to format other components that require the dimensions of the container.

## Limitations

Current version only provides the width of the container in pixels.

## Installation
```shell script
pip install streamlit-dimensions
```
